# SnapchatStats

This project uses your own data from snapchat to generate graphs and statistics about you.

To get started:
1. Download your data: https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/downloadmydata. 
Because snapchat only allows you to download the latest ~30 days of data, you will need to download data regulairy to get a graph longer than 30 days.
Unzip the folder in the data/ folder. Run process.py, it will process all the data and combine it into one single file (data/output.json).
2. Now you can either run generatedailygraph.py or responsetime.py to visualize the data.
